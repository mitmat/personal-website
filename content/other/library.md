# Coding

I love to work with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><i class="fab fa-r-project"></i></a>. You can find some projects on [my Github page](https://github.com/mitmat/).

- Maintainer of `eurocordexr`, an R-package that makes it easier to work with [EURO-CORDEX](https://www.euro-cordex.net/) regional climate model simulation netcdf files. Available via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eurocordexr/index.html) with the [source](https://github.com/mitmat/eurocordexr) on Github.
- Created websites (this one here and the one for [CliRSnow](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/)) with `blogdown`


# Data sets

- Snow cover in the European Alps: Station observations of snow depth and depth of snowfall https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4064128
- Bias adjusted and downscaled snow cover fraction from EURO-CORDEX RCMs for the Greater Alpine Region https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5266359
- Daily MODIS snow cover maps for the European Alps from 2002 onwards at 250m horizontal resolution along with a nearly cloud-free version https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3529517



# Outreach & activism

I [scientifically](https://www.scientistsforfuture.bz/de/scientists-for-future-south-tyrol-deutsch/) support [climate action](https://climateaction.bz/) and activism, for example with fact checks (see, e.g., [1](https://climateaction.bz/faktencheck-dolomiti-superski-vs-klimafakten/) or   [2](https://www.scientistsforfuture.bz/de/2023/08/16/faktencheck-scarafoni-oberkofler/)). In private life, I provide technical advice for [buddhist studies](http://erschbamer.net/) and [a philosophy blog](https://www.erinnermich.eu/).
