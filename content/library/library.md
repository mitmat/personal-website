# Coding

I love to work with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><i class="fab fa-r-project"></i></a>. You can find some projects on [my Github page](https://github.com/mitmat/).

- Maintainer of `eurocordexr`, an R-package that makes it easier to work with [EURO-CORDEX](https://www.euro-cordex.net/) regional climate model simulation netcdf files. Available via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eurocordexr/index.html) with the [source](https://github.com/mitmat/eurocordexr) on Github.
- Created websites (this one here and the one for [CliRSnow](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/)) with `blogdown`
- Some [slides](https://github.com/mitmat/slides) to mostly R-related topics are also online, thanks to `xaringan`


# Data sets

- Snow cover in the European Alps: Station observations of snow depth and depth of snowfall https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4064128
- Bias adjusted and downscaled snow cover fraction from EURO-CORDEX RCMs for the Greater Alpine Region https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5266359
- Daily MODIS snow cover maps for the European Alps from 2002 onwards at 250m horizontal resolution along with a nearly cloud-free version https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3529517



# Outreach & activism

I [scientifically](https://www.scientistsforfuture.bz/de/scientists-for-future-south-tyrol-deutsch/) support [climate action](https://climateaction.bz/) and activism. In private life, I provide technical advice for [buddhist studies](http://erschbamer.net/) and [a philosophy blog](https://www.erinnermich.eu/). 

### Blog entries

- [Techonology won't save us](https://www.eurac.edu/en/blogs/covid-19/time-to-reboot-technology-wont-save-us), as part of Eurac's [Covid-19 and Beyond](https://www.eurac.edu/en/blogs/covid-19) blog
- [The aerial cableway for the climate](https://climateaction.bz/die-cabrio-seilbahn-fur-das-klima/) as part of the "Everyday for Greenwashing" section at [climateaction.bz](https://climateaction.bz/)

### Media

Various interviews related to Alpine snow cover (as part of [CliRSnow](/cherries/clirsnow/)): [past changes](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/communication/media-coverage-alpine-snow-paper/),  [snow in general](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/communication/media-coverage-snow-dossier/), and [future snow](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/communication/media-coverage-future-alps-paper/).
