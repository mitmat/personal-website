   Hi, I'm Michael Matiu, recently finished an EU-funded [research project](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/), and currently teaching mathematics for [school children](https://www.franziskanergymnasium.it/). I'm interested in new opportunities to create knowledge or helping others to learn. Originally, I'm from Romania, grew up in Germany, and currently live with my family in Italy.  
   <br>
   My research interests revolve around [snow cover](https://www.eurac.edu/en/dossiers/dossier-snow-south-tyrol-alps), climate change, and all the fantastic things possible to do with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><i class="fab fa-r-project"></i></a>. Personally, I am inspired by [zenhabits](https://zenhabits.net/), enjoy living in the mountains, and think a [minimalist mindset](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/) would benefit everyone.
