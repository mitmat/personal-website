   Hi, I'm Michael Matiu, recently finished an EU-funded [research project](https://clirsnow.netlify.app/), and currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/). I'm interested in new opportunities to create knowledge or helping others to learn. Originally, I'm from Romania, grew up in Germany, and currently live with my family in Italy.  
   <br>
   My research interests are [snow cover](https://www.eurac.edu/en/dossiers/dossier-snow-south-tyrol-alps), climate change, and their interactions, with a focus on mountain environments. I enjoy programming in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><i class="fab fa-r-project"></i></a> and am regularly amazed by all the fantastic things the R-community makes possible. Personally, I enjoy living in the mountains and think a [minimalist mindset](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/) would benefit everyone.
